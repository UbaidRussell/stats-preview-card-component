## My process

  Took a mobile-first approach and used media queries to make the page responsive for desktops and tablets. I used CSS Grid to position the elements on the page. I used the background-blend-mode property to change the color of the image.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

This code snippet shows how I changed the background color of the image using CSS. I used a div with the image as the background and then used the background-blend-mode property to change the color of the image.

```css
.img{
    background-blend-mode: multiply;
}
```

### Continued development

I want to continue to learn more about CSS Grid and Flexbox. I also want to learn more about CSS animations and transitions.
